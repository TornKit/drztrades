This script requires Tampermonkey
or another user script manager and
depends on Torn Tools using the
"show market value" option for your
Items page.

This  script adds a button to your
Items page which, when clicked,
gathers the items listed (obeying
any filters on the list) and 
displays in a new window a table
with the gathered items listed.
The list contains adjustable
quantity buttons, the market price
for each item, and calculations to
total each item together and
multiply the result by 98%,
displaying to the user the total 
Zoraida will offer for the items
listed in their quantities shown.

Users are encouraged to compare
results of my offer method with
other, flashier lists that
calculate "market value" every 15
minutes under the guise of being
better for the supplier. My method
won't always provide the best
price, but you'll always be able to
see my offer before even setting the
trade and you'll *never* calculate an
offer faster.

List empty or not displaying all your
items? Ensure the following:
- Your list is not filtered
- You are using Torn Tools and market
  values are shown on your Items page
- You have scrolled to the bottom of
  the page before clicking the button
- You are not trying to sell items
  in excluded categories:
  - Primary
  - Secondary
  - Melee
  - Defensive
  - Others to be added

Planned enhancements
- Quantity boxes accept user input
- Parameterized buying
  configuration (basically
  opening it up to other traders
  more than it already is by making
  some behaviors easily adjustable)
- Removal of TT dependency
- Torn PDA compatibility
